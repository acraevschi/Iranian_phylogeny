# Iranian_phylogeny
The data and code used for the term paper for course "How language changes with special reference to syntax", held in the Summer Semester 20/21 at the university of Bamberg by prof. Geoffrey Haig.

To reproduce the models introduced in the paper, use Beasting to produce XML file for BEAST, or use the XML file provided in the respective folder directly to launch the inference of phylogeny. 
Keep in mind that all of the models were run 3 times to ensure that sufficient number of ESS were sampled and to ensure that mixing of chains was achieved.
